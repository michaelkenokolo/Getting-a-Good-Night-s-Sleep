# Getting-a-Good-Night-Sleep
SleepInc created an application to track their user's sleep patterns and lifestyle choices called SleepScope. In this notebook, we analyze anonymized data of 374 individuals and their relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality. 

The `sleep_health_data.csv` dataset contains average values for each person calculated over the past six months, which include: Sleep duration, Quality, Disorders, Exercise, Stress, Diet, Demographics, and other factors related to sleep health.

Some of the patterns explored in the notebook included:
1. Occupation with the lowest average sleep duration,
2. Occupation with the  lowest average sleep quality, and
3. How the BMI affects sleep disorder rates among users
