# Getting-a-Good-Night-Sleep
SleepInc created an application to track their user's sleep patterns and lifestyle choices called SleepScope. In this notebook, we analyze anonymized data of 374 individuals and their relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality. 
The `sleep_health_data.csv` dataset contains average values for each person calculated over the past six months, which include:
* Sleep duration
* Quality
* Disorders
* Exercise
* Stress
* Diet
* Demographics, and other factors related to sleep health.
